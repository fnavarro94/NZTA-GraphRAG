Landscaping would be an essential part of these conservation efforts to ensure that the cottage’s surroundings reflect its historical significance and maintain its aesthetic and cultural value.

Subsequent Land Use: The response indicates that once the restoration is complete, the land around the cottage will be subdivided and possibly reviewed for further requirements by NZTA. Proper landscaping is likely part of preparing the property for this subdivision and potential future use. It helps in defining the boundaries of the subdivided land and in making the property appealing for whatever purpose it will serve next.

Environmental and Visual Integration: Although the house has been moved 20 meters east from its original location, efforts are being made to maintain its orientation and outlook over the Ōtaki River. Landscaping would help in integrating the cottage into its new position, ensuring that the relocated structure harmonizes with its surroundings and retains its historical and visual significance.",,correct,correct,correct
